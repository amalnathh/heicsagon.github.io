                    In Einstein's studies, he began to notice inconsistencies of Newtonian mechanics in their relation
                    to
                    the understanding of electromagnetism, specifically Maxwell's equations. In a paper published in
                    September 1905, he proposed a new way of thinking about the mechanics of objects approaching the
                    speed of light.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    This concept became known as Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. It changed the understanding
                    of
                    physics at the. <br>

                    Understanding the Special Theory of Relativity can be a little difficult, but we'll boil it down to
                    a simple situation. <br>

                    He began with the understanding that light always travels at a constant 300,000 km/s, and asked what
                    would happen to our ideas of space and time if that was the case? If you fire a laser at something
                    moving half the speed of light, the laser beam still keeps this constant, and it doesn't travel at
                    one and a half times the speed of light.

                <h1 class="accordion">Avogadro's Number</h1>
                <div class="panel"><br>
                  <p>
                    For anyone that has made it through a chemistry class, you likely remember Avogadro's number or it,
                    at least, rings a bell.
                  </p><br>

                  <p>
                    While Einstein was working to explain Brownian motion, the erratic movement of particles in a fluid,
                    he also determined an expression for the quantity of Avogadro's number in terms of measurable
                    quantities.
                  </p><br>

                  <p>
                    All of this meant that scientists now had a way to determine the mass of an atom, or the molar mass
                    for each element on the periodic table.

                <h1 class="accordion">The Bose-Einstein Condensate</h1>
                <div class="panel"><br>
                  <p>
                    In 1924, Einstein was sent a paper from a physicist by the name of Satyendra Nath Bose. This paper
                    discussed detailed a way to think of light as a gas, filled with indistinguishable particles.
                    <br>
                    Einstein worked with Bose to extend this idea to atoms, which led to a prediction for a new state of
                    matter: the Bose-Einstein Condensate. The first example of this state was produced in 1995.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    A Bose-Einstein condensate is essentially a group of atoms that are cooled very close to absolute
                    zero. When they reach that temperature, they hardly move in relation to one another. They begin to
                    clump together and enter into exactly the same energy states. This means that, from a physical point
                    of view, the group of atoms behaves as if they were a single atom.

                <h1 class="accordion">General theory of relativity</h1>
                <div class="panel"><br>
                  <p>
                    In 1916, Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity. This paper generalizes the concepts of
                    Special Relativity and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, describing gravity as a property of
                    space and time. This theory has aided our understanding of how the large-scale structure of the
                    universe is set up.
                  </p><br>

                  <p>The Theory of General Relativity can be explained like this:</p><br>

                  <p>
                    Newton helped quantify gravity between two objects as a tugging of two bodies, independent of how
                    massive each one is or how far apart they are. <br>

                    Einstein determined that the laws of physics hold constant for all non-accelerating observers, that
                    the speed of light is constant no matter how fast the observer travels. He found that space and time
                    were interwoven and that events that occur at one time for one observer could occur at a different
                    time for the next.
                  </p><br>

                  <p>This led to his theory that massive objects in space could distort spacetime.</p><br>

                  <p>
                    Einstein's predictions have helped modern physicists study and understand black holes and
                    gravitational lensing.

                </div>
                <h1 class="accordion">The Photoelectric Effect</h1>
                <div class="panel">
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Einstein's theory of the Photoelectric Effect discusses the emissions of electrons from metal when
                    light shines on it, as we alluded to before. Scientists had observed this phenomenon and had been
                    unable to reconcile the finding with Maxwell's wave theory of light.
                  </p><br>

                  <p>
                    His discovery of photons aided the understanding of this phenomenon. He theorized that, as light
                    hits
                    an object, there is an emission of electrons, which he deemed photoelectrons.
                  </p><br>

                  <p>
                    This model formed the basis of how solar cells work - light causes atoms to release electrons, which
                    generate a current, and then creating electricity.

                <h1 class="accordion">Wave-Particle Duality</h1>
                <div class="panel">
                  <br>
                  <p>
                    Einstein's research into the development of the quantum theory was some of the most impactful he
                    ever
                    accomplished. During his early career, Einstein persisted in asserting that light should be treated
                    as both a wave and a particle. In other words, photons can behave as particles and as waves at the
                    same time. This became known as wave-particle duality.
                  </p><br>

                  <p>
                    He is quoted as saying this on the subject, "We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two
                    contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light,
                    but together they do."
                  </p><br>

                  <p>
                    As we think about all of Einstein's "inventions," we have to think of them in the light of his
                    influence. His work advanced modern quantum mechanics, the model of physical time, the understanding
                    of light, solar panels, and even modern chemistry.
                  </p><br>
                  <p>
                    Einstein's has unequivocally influenced our understanding of physics as we know it today.
