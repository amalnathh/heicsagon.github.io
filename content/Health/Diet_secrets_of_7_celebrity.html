            <h1>Diet secrets of 7 celebrities :</h1>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Celebrities always look fabulous. Whether appearing in television or films or strutting down the red
                carpet during movie premiers and awards, they never cease to fascinate us with their larger than life
                presence. The truth is, it takes a lot of effort to look the way they do, and being the public figures
                that they are, they cannot afford to slack off when it comes to taking care of their physical
                appearances. Their livelihood largely depends on how they look. Aside from the clothes, the hair and the
                makeup, celebrities have to take good care of their bodies.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>So it is no surprise that these stars have their own secrets when it comes to staying fit and gorgeous.
                Their health agenda can range from extreme workouts to well-planned meals. Who doesn&#39;t want to know
                their secrets in staying absolutely sexy? Here are some of the diet secrets of seven women celebrities.
            </p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>1. Jennifer Aniston</h3>
            <p>The star of the phenomenal television show Friends not only mesmerized audiences with her adorable comic
                sense and her famous hairstyle, she was also known for having one of the sexiest bodies in Hollywood, as
                she appeared in countless magazine covers. To stay trim, Jennifer follows the 40:30:30 diet method. The
                diet consists of:</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <ul>
                <li>40% Low glycemic carbohydrates <br>
                    -Foods such as beans, fruits and vegetables, legumes</li>
                <p><br></p>
                <li>30% lean proteins <br>
                    -Tofu, fish, chicken, turkey, beef and low fat dairy products</li>
                <p><br></p>
                <li>30% essential fats <br>
                    -nuts and seeds, fish and olive oils</li>
            </ul>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>It is essential that every meal should contain macronutrients to attain the balance of hormones and
                maximum weight loss.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>2. Kate Hudson</h3>
            <p>The gorgeous daughter of actress Goldie Hawn gained 60 pounds during her pregnancy, which she needed to
                shed quickly before commencing on her next film. From her previous eating plan, she switched to a higher
                protein diet. She consumed high protein meals in smaller portions, and she combined this diet with an
                exercise program that includes weight training and cardiovascular workouts. After getting a lot of flak
                because of her post-pregnancy figure, Kate removed all that baby weight in only four months and has
                gained abdominal muscles that gained the envy of many in Hollywood.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>3. Oprah Winfrey</h3>
            <p>As one of the most successful talk-show hosts in the world, there is no question that Oprah needs to
                maintain her physical appearance for her millions of audiences. Known as one of those celebrities who
                are constantly battling weight gain, she has recently toned up her figure and has never looked figure in
                age 50 by combining a regular exercise regime and diet plan. Oprah works out five days a week, spending
                30 minutes on the threadmill and doing free weights. Her eating plan consists of legumes, fish, nuts,
                fruits and vegetables, chicken and dairy products that are lowfat. She limits her consumption of white
                sugar and flour. Oprah also credits her trim figure to her habit of not eating anything after seven in
                the evening.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>4. Gwyneth Paltrow</h3>
            <p>A lot of people may find it hard to believe that the perpetually slim Academy award-winning actress
                actually needs to diet. Gwyneth actually follows a healthy eating plan that resembles Oprah&#39;s,
                avoiding sugar and white flour. She usually follows a macrobiotic diet, eating foods like vegetables,
                brown rice, and lean meat. She also eliminated dairy from her diet, and does yoga everyday.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>5. Madonna</h3>
            <p>The pop star known as the Material Girl has always flaunted a body that is to die for, and has become a
                true fitness paragon over the years. She keeps herself in tip-top shape by having Ashtanga Yoga, and
                follows a strict diet that mostly shuns junk foods. She adopted a macrobiotic eating plan that includes
                organic foods rich in lean protein.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>6. Claudia Schiffer</h3>
            <p>The bodacious German supermodel eats salad and steamed vegetables for dinner and eats only fruits before
                the afternoon. While on locations, she prefers to eat black grapes and drinks tomato juice and herbal
                tea.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <h3>7. Christie Brinkley</h3>
            <p>Long-time supermodel maintains her all-American good looks by being a vegetarian. She does not keep junk
                foods of any kind inside her home to make sure that she does not eat them when cravings occur. She
                snacks on sweet potatoes in place of candy bars, and she adopts a liquid juice diet when she needs to
                slim down fast.</p>
            <p><br></p>
            <p>Celebrities are just like ordinary people. They need to maintain their figures just like anyone else, and
                there is more pressure on their part since they are constantly in the public eye. Ordinary folks can
                have celebrity-like bodies, too, and by following these diet and fitness plans, they can also look like
                red-carpet worthy. &nbsp;</p>
