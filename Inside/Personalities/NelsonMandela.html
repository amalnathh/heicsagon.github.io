                <p>
                    Rolihlahla Mandela was born into the Madiba clan in the village of Mvezo, in the Eastern Cape, on 18
                    July 1918. His mother was Nonqaphi Nosekeni and his father was Nkosi Mphakanyiswa Gadla Mandela,
                    principal counsellor to the Acting King of the Thembu people, Jongintaba Dalindyebo. In 1930, when
                    he was 12 years old, his father died and the young Rolihlahla became a ward of Jongintaba at the
                    Great Place in Mqhekezweni1.

                    Hearing the elders’ stories of his ancestors’ valour during the wars of resistance, he dreamed also
                    of making his own contribution to the freedom struggle of his people.

                <p>
                    Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and
                    philanthropist who served as President of South Africa
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    He attended primary school in Qunu where his teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave him the name Nelson, in
                    accordance with the custom of giving all schoolchildren “Christian” names.

                    He completed his Junior Certificate at Clarkebury Boarding Institute and went on to Healdtown, a
                    Wesleyan secondary school of some repute, where he matriculated.

                    Mandela began his studies for a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University College of Fort Hare but
                    did not complete the degree there as he was expelled for joining in a student protest.
                    <br>
                    On his return to the Great Place at Mqhekezweni the King was furious and said if he didn’t return to
                    Fort Hare he would arrange wives for him and his cousin Justice. They ran away to Johannesburg
                    instead, arriving there in 1941. There he worked as a mine security officer and after meeting Walter
                    Sisulu, an estate agent, he was introduced to Lazer Sidelsky. He then did his articles through a
                    firm of attorneys – Witkin, Eidelman and Sidelsky.

                    He completed his BA through the University of South Africa and went back to Fort Hare for his
                    graduation in 1943.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile, he began studying for an LLB at the University of the Witwatersrand. By his own admission
                    he was a poor student and left the university in 1952 without graduating. He only started studying
                    again through the University of London after his imprisonment in 1962 but also did not complete that
                    degree.
                    <br>
                    In 1989, while in the last months of his imprisonment, he obtained an LLB through the University of
                    South Africa. He graduated in absentia at a ceremony in Cape Town.

                <h2>Politics</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    Mandela, while increasingly politically involved from 1942, only joined the African National Congress
                    in 1944 when he helped to form the ANC Youth League (ANCYL).

                    In 1944 he married Walter Sisulu’s cousin, Evelyn Mase, a nurse. They had two sons, Madiba
                    Thembekile "Thembi" and Makgatho, and two daughters both called Makaziwe, the first of whom died in
                    infancy. He and his wife divorced in 1958.

                    Mandela rose through the ranks of the ANCYL and through its efforts, the ANC adopted a more radical
                    mass-based policy, the Programme of Action, in 1949.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1952 he was chosen as the National Volunteer-in-Chief of the Defiance Campaign with Maulvi
                    Cachalia as his deputy. This campaign of civil disobedience against six unjust laws was a joint
                    programme between the ANC and the South African Indian Congress. He and 19 others were charged under
                    the Suppression of Communism Act for their part in the campaign and sentenced to nine months of hard
                    labour, suspended for two years.
                    <br>
                    A two-year diploma in law on top of his BA allowed Mandela to practise law, and in August 1952 he
                    and Oliver Tambo established South Africa’s first black law firm, Mandela & Tambo.

                    At the end of 1952 he was banned for the first time. As a restricted person he was only permitted to
                    watch in secret as the Freedom Charter was adopted in Kliptown on 26 June 1955.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mandela was arrested in a countrywide police swoop on 5 December 1956, which led to the 1956 Treason
                    Trial. Men and women of all races found themselves in the dock in the marathon trial that only ended
                    when the last 28 accused, including Mandela, were acquitted on 29 March 1961.

                    On 21 March 1960 police killed 69 unarmed people in a protest in Sharpeville against the pass laws.
                    This led to the country’s first state of emergency and the banning of the ANC and the Pan Africanist
                    Congress (PAC) on 8 April. Mandela and his colleagues in the Treason Trial were among thousands
                    detained during the state of emergency.

                    During the trial Mandela married a social worker, Winnie Madikizela, on 14 June 1958. They had two
                    daughters, Zenani and Zindziswa. The couple divorced in 1996.
                    <br>
                    Days before the end of the Treason Trial, Mandela travelled to Pietermaritzburg to speak at the
                    All-in Africa Conference, which resolved that he should write to Prime Minister Verwoerd requesting
                    a national convention on a non-racial constitution, and to warn that should he not agree there would
                    be a national strike against South Africa becoming a republic. After he and his colleagues were
                    acquitted in the Treason Trial, Mandela went underground and began planning a national strike for
                    29, 30 and 31 March.

                    In the face of massive mobilisation of state security the strike was called off early. In June 1961
                    he was asked to lead the armed struggle and helped to establish Umkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the
                    Nation), which launched on 16 December 1961 with a series of explosions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 11 January 1962, using the adopted name David Motsamayi, Mandela secretly left South Africa. He
                    travelled around Africa and visited England to gain support for the armed struggle. He received
                    military training in Morocco and Ethiopia and returned to South Africa in July 1962. He was arrested
                    in a police roadblock outside Howick on 5 August while returning from KwaZulu-Natal, where he had
                    briefed ANC President Chief Albert Luthuli about his trip.
                    <br>
                    He was charged with leaving the country without a permit and inciting workers to strike. He was
                    convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment, which he began serving at the Pretoria Local
                    Prison. On 27 May 1963 he was transferred to Robben Island and returned to Pretoria on 12 June.
                    Within a month police raided Liliesleaf, a secret hideout in Rivonia, Johannesburg, used by ANC and
                    Communist Party activists, and several of his comrades were arrested.

                    On 9 October 1963 Mandela joined 10 others on trial for sabotage in what became known as the Rivonia
                    Trial. While facing the death penalty his words to the court at the end of his famous "Speech from
                    the Dock" on 20 April 1964 became immortalised: <br><br>
                    <q>
                        I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have
                        cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in
                        harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve.
                        But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.
                    </q><br><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 11 June 1964 Mandela and seven other accused, Walter Sisulu, Ahmed Kathrada, Govan Mbeki, Raymond
                    Mhlaba, Denis Goldberg, Elias Motsoaledi and Andrew Mlangeni, were convicted and the next day were
                    sentenced to life imprisonment. Goldberg was sent to Pretoria Prison because he was white, while the
                    others went to Robben Island.
                    <br>
                    Mandela’s mother died in 1968 and his eldest son, Thembi, in 1969. He was not allowed to attend
                    their funerals.

                    On 31 March 1982 Mandela was transferred to Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town with Sisulu, Mhlaba and
                    Mlangeni. Kathrada joined them in October. When he returned to the prison in November 1985 after
                    prostate surgery, Mandela was held alone. Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee visited him in hospital.
                    Later Mandela initiated talks about an ultimate meeting between the apartheid government and the
                    ANC.
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    During his years in prison, Nelson Mandela’s reputation grew steadily. He was widely accepted as the most significant black leader in South Africa and became a potent symbol of resistance as the anti-apartheid movement gathered strength. He consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom.

                    Nelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. After his release, he plunged himself wholeheartedly into his life’s work, striving to attain the goals he and others had set out almost four decades earlier. In 1991, at the first national conference of the ANC held inside South Africa after the organization had been banned in 1960, Mandela was elected President of the ANC while his lifelong friend and colleague, Oliver Tambo, became the organisation’s National Chairperson.
                </p>
                <h2>Release from prison</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    On 12 August 1988 he was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. After more than
                    three months in two hospitals he was transferred on 7 December 1988 to a house at Victor Verster
                    Prison near Paarl where he spent his last 14 months of imprisonment. He was released from its gates
                    on Sunday 11 February 1990, nine days after the unbanning of the ANC and the PAC and nearly four
                    months after the release of his remaining Rivonia comrades. Throughout his imprisonment he had
                    rejected at least three conditional offers of release.
                    <br>
                    Mandela immersed himself in official talks to end white minority rule and in 1991 was elected ANC
                    President to replace his ailing friend, Oliver Tambo. In 1993 he and President FW de Klerk jointly
                    won the Nobel Peace Prize and on 27 April 1994 he voted for the first time in his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 10 May 1994 he was inaugurated as South Africa’s first democratically elected President. On his
                    80th birthday in 1998 he married Graça Machel, his third wife.
                    <br>
                    True to his promise, Mandela stepped down in 1999 after one term as President. He continued to work
                    with the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund he set up in 1995 and established the Nelson Mandela
                    Foundation and The Mandela Rhodes Foundation.

                    <br>
                    In April 2007 his grandson, Mandla Mandela, was installed as head of the Mvezo Traditional Council
                    at a ceremony at the Mvezo Great Place.
                    <br>
                    Nelson Mandela never wavered in his devotion to democracy, equality and learning. Despite terrible
                    provocation, he never answered racism with racism. His life is an inspiration to all who are
                    oppressed and deprived; and to all who are opposed to oppression and deprivation.
                    <br>
                    He died at his home in Johannesburg on 5 December 2013.
