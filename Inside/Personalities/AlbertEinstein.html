                    Albert Einstein is arguably the most influential scientist of the 20th century. His general theory
                    of relativity changed our understanding of space and time, becoming one of the two pillars of modern
                    physics – the other being quantum mechanics.
                </p><br><br>

                <p>
                    The German-born physicist’s most famous equation, E = mc2, states that anything with mass has an
                    equivalent amount of energy, and vice versa.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It arose from his special theory of relativity, which proposed that in the vacuum of space, the
                    speed of light is always the same, regardless of the movement of the person observing it. It led to
                    a new way of looking at the universe: suggesting that space and time can’t be separated from one
                    another, but rather are interwoven in a continuum. It also suggested that measurements of distance
                    and time both change as you get closer to the speed of light: clocks run slower and lengths appear
                    to get shorter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the same year, aged just 26, he developed three other ground-breaking theories – on Brownian
                    motion, mass-energy equivalence, and the law of the photoelectric effect, for which he went on to
                    win the Nobel Prize in 1921
                </p>.
                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Expanding his special theory, Einstein’s general theory of relativity states that what we perceive as
                    the force of gravity between two masses actually arises from their warping of space and time. For
                    example, although the sun’s gravity appears to pull the earth towards it, no such force really
                    exists; instead, the geometry of space-time around the sun dictates how the earth moves.
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to the theory, time moves more slowly when gravity is stronger: clocks tick slower at sea
                    level than at the top of a mountain, where the tug of Earth’s gravity is weaker.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Going against the predominant view at the time, the theory also predicted that the universe is
                    expanding, which the astronomer Edwin Hubble confirmed in 1929.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Einstein’s general theory of relativity explained the motion of planets and the bending of light from
                    distant stars and galaxies, and predicted the existence of black holes and gravitational waves.
                    These waves – ripples in space-time – were detected directly for the first time in 2016, a century
                    after he first theorised them.

                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Albert Einstein was born in 1879 in Ulm, Germany. He was the first child born to Hermann and Pauline
                    Einstein. Though he attended school as a young boy, he also received instruction at home on Judaism
                    and violin. By the age of twelve he had taught himself geometry. At the age of sixteen he failed an
                    exam in order to qualify to train as an electrical engineer. He remained in school and developed a
                    new plan for his future. Einstein decided to study math and physics so he could become a teacher.
                    Einstein thought he would be good at this because he could think mathematically and abstractly while
                    lacking imagination and practicality. In 1896 he renounced his German citizenship. He was not a
                    citizen of any country until 1901 when he became a citizen of Switzerland. In 1900 he graduated as a
                    teacher of math and physics. His teachers did not think very highly of him though so he had
                    difficulty being recommended for a job at a university. In 1901 he took a job as a temporary high
                    school teacher and married Mileva Maritsch. The couple had two sons prior to divorcing. Einstein
                    later married his cousin Elsa Einstein. From 1902 through 1909, Einstein worked in a patent office
                    in Bern, Switzerland. While working in the patent office he published many papers on theoretical
                    physics. He earned a Ph.D. in 1905.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    In 1905 Einstein wrote a paper on what is now known as the special theory of relativity. This paper
                    contained two hypotheses. The first stated that the laws of physics had to have the same form in any
                    frame of reference. The second hypothesis stated that the speed of light was a constant. Later that
                    year Einstein also showed how mass and energy were equivalent. Following an impressive few years of
                    work, Einstein became a lecturer at the University of Bern. In 1909 he finally got a post at a
                    university when he became a faculty member at the University of Zurich. In 1911 Einstein taught at
                    Carl-Ferdinand University in Prague. The following year he returned to Germany to continue his work.
                    In 1916 Einstein published his general theory of relativity. This theory linked gravitation,
                    acceleration and the four dimensional space-time. With this theory he was able to account for the
                    variations in the orbital motions of the planets. He also predicted that starlight in the vicinity
                    of a massive object such as the Sun could be bent. This was confirmed in 1919 during a solar
                    eclipse. This further increased the adulation with which the press viewed Einstein. He won the Nobel
                    Prize for Physics in 1921 for his work on the photoelectric effect. This work proposed that light be
                    considered as consisting of particles called photons. Einstein further proposed that the energy the
                    photon contains is proportional to the frequency of the radiation.
                </p><br><br>
                <p>
                    Einstein was not only a scientist, but also a social activist and a humanitarian. He spoke out
                    against the German involvement in World War I. In 1920 a demonstration interrupted a lecture given
                    by Einstein in Berlin. There was also growing criticism of his work by certain Germans. Einstein
                    felt the disruptions and criticisms were occurring because he was Jewish. Einstein traveled the
                    world lecturing and raising funds for a planned Hebrew University in Jerusalem. His hectic lifestyle
                    led to a physical collapse in 1928. By 1930 he was once again travelling the world, especially the
                    United States. On one of these visits, he was offered a post with the Institute for Advanced Study
                    near Princeton University. Einstein accepted, believing that he would spend seven months of the year
                    in Munich and five months of the year in the United States. In December of 1932 he left for the
                    United States. A month after his departure the Nazis assumed control of Germany. Einstein never
                    returned to Germany. In 1935 Einstein was granted permanent residency in the United States and
                    became a citizen in 1940. In 1944 he hand wrote his 1905 theory on relativity and allowed it to be
                    auctioned. It sold for six million dollars, which he donated to the effort to win World War II. The
                    work resides in the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. By 1949 Einstein was in failing health.
                    His health was so bad that when offered the presidency of Israel in 1952 he had to decline it. In
                    1955, one week prior to his death, he agreed to have his name appear on a manifesto calling for the
                    end to nuclear weapons. He died in April of 1955 in Princeton, New Jersey. Einstein was cremated and
                    his ashes were spread at an undisclosed location.

                <h2>Quantum Theory of Light</h2><br>
                <p>
                    Einstein proposed his theory of light, stating that all light is composed of tiny packets of energy,
                    called photons. He suggested these photons were particles but also had wave-like properties, a
                    totally new idea at the time.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    He also spent some time outlining the emission of electrons from metals as they were hit with large
                    electric pulses, like lightning. He expanded on this concept of the photoelectric effect, which
                    we'll discuss later in this article.
                </p><br><br><br>
                <h2>Special Theory of Relativity</h2><br>

                <p>
                    In Einstein's studies, he began to notice inconsistencies of Newtonian mechanics in their relation to
                    the understanding of electromagnetism, specifically Maxwell's equations. In a paper published in
                    September 1905, he proposed a new way of thinking about the mechanics of objects approaching the
                    speed of light.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    This concept became known as Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity. It changed the understanding of
                    physics at the. <br>

                    Understanding the Special Theory of Relativity can be a little difficult, but we'll boil it down to
                    a simple situation. <br>

                    He began with the understanding that light always travels at a constant 300,000 km/s, and asked what
                    would happen to our ideas of space and time if that was the case? If you fire a laser at something
                    moving half the speed of light, the laser beam still keeps this constant, and it doesn't travel at
                    one and a half times the speed of light.
                </p><br><br><br>

                <h2>Avogadro's Number</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    For anyone that has made it through a chemistry class, you likely remember Avogadro's number or it,
                    at least, rings a bell.
                </p><br>


                <p>
                    While Einstein was working to explain Brownian motion, the erratic movement of particles in a fluid,
                    he also determined an expression for the quantity of Avogadro's number in terms of measurable
                    quantities.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    All of this meant that scientists now had a way to determine the mass of an atom, or the molar mass
                    for each element on the periodic table.
                </p><br><br><br>

                <h2>The Bose-Einstein Condensate</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    In 1924, Einstein was sent a paper from a physicist by the name of Satyendra Nath Bose. This paper
                    discussed detailed a way to think of light as a gas, filled with indistinguishable particles.
                    <br>
                    Einstein worked with Bose to extend this idea to atoms, which led to a prediction for a new state of
                    matter: the Bose-Einstein Condensate. The first example of this state was produced in 1995.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A Bose-Einstein condensate is essentially a group of atoms that are cooled very close to absolute
                    zero. When they reach that temperature, they hardly move in relation to one another. They begin to
                    clump together and enter into exactly the same energy states. This means that, from a physical point
                    of view, the group of atoms behaves as if they were a single atom.
                </p><br><br><br>

                <h2>General Theory of Relativity </h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    In 1916, Einstein published his General Theory of Relativity. This paper generalizes the concepts of
                    Special Relativity and Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, describing gravity as a property of
                    space and time. This theory has aided our understanding of how the large-scale structure of the
                    universe is set up.
                </p><br>

                <p>The Theory of General Relativity can be explained like this:</p><br>

                <p>
                    Newton helped quantify gravity between two objects as a tugging of two bodies, independent of how
                    massive each one is or how far apart they are. <br>

                    Einstein determined that the laws of physics hold constant for all non-accelerating observers, that
                    the speed of light is constant no matter how fast the observer travels. He found that space and time
                    were interwoven and that events that occur at one time for one observer could occur at a different

                <p>This led to his theory that massive objects in space could distort spacetime.</p><br>

                <p>
                    Einstein's predictions have helped modern physicists study and understand black holes and
                    gravitational lensing.

                <h2>The Photoelectric Effect</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    Einstein's theory of the Photoelectric Effect discusses the emissions of electrons from metal when
                    light shines on it, as we alluded to before. Scientists had observed this phenomenon and had been
                    unable to reconcile the finding with Maxwell's wave theory of light.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    His discovery of photons aided the understanding of this phenomenon. He theorized that, as light hits
                    an object, there is an emission of electrons, which he deemed photoelectrons.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    This model formed the basis of how solar cells work - light causes atoms to release electrons, which
                    generate a current, and then creating electricity.
                </p><br><br><br>
                <h2>Wave-Particle Duality</h2><br><br>
                <p>
                    Einstein's research into the development of the quantum theory was some of the most impactful he ever
                    accomplished. During his early career, Einstein persisted in asserting that light should be treated
                    as both a wave and a particle. In other words, photons can behave as particles and as waves at the
                    same time. This became known as wave-particle duality.
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    He is quoted as saying this on the subject, "We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two
                    contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light,
                    but together they do."
                </p><br>

                <p>
                    As we think about all of Einstein's "inventions," we have to think of them in the light of his
                    influence. His work advanced modern quantum mechanics, the model of physical time, the understanding
                    of light, solar panels, and even modern chemistry.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Einstein's has unequivocally influenced our understanding of physics as we know it today.
